## Introduction
This repository contains my solutions for the weekly problem sets and the final project for Harvard University's CS50 Introduction to Databases with SQL course. It demonstrates various concepts learned throughout the course, including database design, SQL querying, constraints, views, indexes, and triggers.

### [Final Project](./Final-Project) üèÜ

#### Final Project: Neighbourly ü§ù - Local Marketplace Support System

The final project involved designing and implementing a database schema for a conceptual local marketplace application.

**Key focus areas:**
* Designed a relational database schema with appropriate entities and relationships.
* Focused on data integrity using foreign key constraints, and column constraints.
* Optimized query performance with `VIEW`s, `INDEX`s, and `TRIGGER`s.	
* Ensured all the relevant data movements are logged for further analysis.

**‚û°Ô∏è Find the full project details, schema, queries, ER Diagram, and video presentation in the [Final-Project folder](./Final-Project/).**
*(Make sure to check out the `README.md` within the `Final-Project` folder for a detailed explanation!)*
